## About Me
Hello, my name is Miller DeMark, I am a Computer Science major, due for graduation Summer 2026 from Montana Tech. I got my start in CS in high school working for our IT department, from there, my passion for technology flourished into the skills I have developed today. These skills include, but are not limited to, programming in many different languages, embedded systems, networking, game design, and data mining. In my free time I like to fish, mountain bike, hunt with my dog, and work on home projects to expand my knowledge in these fields.
