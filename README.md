## About Portfolio
I'll be keeping shorter documentation on this portfolio for simplicity's sake. Full code, designs, and more can be seen on the respective repositories, this portfolio is meant to be a quick peek into projects.

## About Me
My name is Miller DeMark, I am a Computer Science major, due for graduation Summer 2026 from Montana Tech. I got my start in CS in high school working for our IT department, from there, my passion for technology flourished into the skills I have developed today. These skills include, but are not limited to, programming in many different languages, embedded systems, networking, game design, and data mining. In my free time I like to fish, mountain bike, hunt with my dog, and work on home projects to expand my knowledge in these fields. I hope this portfolio serves as a useful tool in judging my experience and technical ability.

## Project Outlines
- Homelab Hospital Network [docs](docs/homelab-hospital-doc.md)/[repo](https://github.com/mdemark18/Homelab-Hospital-Network)<br>
This is a custom network setup I created using a 4 port NIC, 4 virtual machines, a Cisco Router, and a Cisco Switch to emulate a hospital network and how different VLANs would function together. This is further tied together with the use of open source software to fully emulate the computers and software that may be used between departmetns.
- ESP32 Fish Tank Monitor[docs](docs/tank-monitor-doc.md)/[repo](https://github.com/mdemark18/Tank_Monitor)<br>
This is a current project that is made to create a fish tank monitor soluition. As an avid aquarium keeper, this is going to save some headaches by tracking water temp and level on an ESP32, and send that data from my multiple tanks onto a central server to quickly check and get alerts for critical tank levels. This includes custom PCBs and future 3D printed housings for the monitors. More features to come as I tinker.
- Miller's Games [docs](docs/millers-games-doc.md)/[repo](https://github.com/mdemark18/WebProgramming25)<br>
This is a website I created for my Web Programming course in Spring 2025. This site is a fucntional game marketpalce much like BestBuy's site or Gamestop's. All features are functional short of actually having stock and shipping it to you! Forgive the GitHub repo, this is temporary as I get the site hosted online.
